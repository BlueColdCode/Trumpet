This is the guide to replicate the result of DoS resiliency for Trumpet.
- To get the result for Syn DoS attack copy the dos1pktscript.sh file into the receiver folder and run it
- For the result of DoS attacks that can send more than a threshold run dosscript.sh. 
Note that the output summary file needs postprocessing to get the maximum feasible DoS BW% and minimum feasible DoS threshold out of the packet loss rate and not finished sweep rates.
