This is the guide to re-run the loss and burst example from the trumpet paper. In this example, we have a sender and receiver connected from a bottleneck line that also has shallow buffer. Making the shallow buffer requires a switch that lets us limit its buffer size. You can refer the config.txt file to see how I did it for ME3600 switch.

The guide is not complete as this usecase implementation is not complete in this version of trumpet.
